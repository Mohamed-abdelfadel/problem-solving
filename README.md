# Problem-Solving 
#### This repository was created to contain all the problems I solved recently in LeetCode and CodeForces (for now). I hope you encourage me and make my answers more efficient 

## Technologies used:
* Java
* Streams
* Lists

## What it does:
  As mentioned it is a problem-solving repository, feel free to review it, I will be happy if you added something I didn't know
  Its educational purpose is just to solve problems and try to make comments to clarify why I did these steps instead of others

## How to get the project 
* Make sure to have some kind of IDE that runs Java (IntelliJ, Eclipse)

* Setup new Java project
* Clone the files into your project

## Found an issue?
  if you found a bug or searching for improvement feel free to submit it in the issues tab 

## Known issues (in progress):
* Code Forces -> Assuit University -> Data types -> ProblemO : needs some enhancements
